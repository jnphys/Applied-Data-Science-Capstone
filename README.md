In this repository, you'll find notebooks completed during **"Applied Data Science Capstone"** course, which is the final recap of my **"IBM Professional Data Science"** program. These notebooks illustrate different data science steps and also include a Python script for an interactive web-based dash application. They briefly reflect the main data science and coding skills I've learned during my training.
