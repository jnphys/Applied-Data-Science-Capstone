In this repository, you'll find notebooks completed during my **"Applied Data Science Capstone"** course, which is the final part of my **"IBM Professional Data Science Certificate"** program. These notebooks illustrate different data science steps and also include a Python script for an interactive Dash web application.

I want to clarify that I don't own these notebooks entirely, as their templates were done as part of my certification. However, they do reflect the main data science and coding skills I've learned during my courses. I'd appreciate any feedback you have to offer!
